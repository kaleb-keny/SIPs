## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

Open up a new new merging window for a 2 week period.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

Proposing to trigger the `startMergingWindow` method which initiates a new merging epoch.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Given sDAO's intention to migrate to a new account, this SCCP proposes to open up the account merging window for a 2-week period.
