## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

Decrease the number of Spartan Council seats back to 7 members from 8 members.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

This SCCP is relating to the configurable number of council members specified in SIP-93.
The initial number of Spartan Council members was increased to 8 as it was noticed that the top 7 members were changing frequently in a given epoch. However, with SIP-104 amendment, members will locked until a new election cycle begins.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Although I find that all the current Spartan members, with no exception, are simply great talented individuals and it would be really a shame to not include more people on the council (I'm referring to Jacko Wacko specifically). I believe that for the assigned responsibility, 7 members are more than enough to cater for requirements of voting on SIPs' and SCCPs'.
Many have raised reasonable objections, that the current make-up & composition works great. I don't disagree on that point, but I can say that 7 members will not disappoint. Furthermore, with the recently announced grantsDAO and synthetix-ambassadors roles opening up, this would help in spreading talent on the different areas of the protocol.
I do want to end by mentioning, that having a lower number of available seats helps in ensuring that stakeholders votes are focused on few (as opposed to spread out on many) and it also paves the way for a more thrilling voting experience.
