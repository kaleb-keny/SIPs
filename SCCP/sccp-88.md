## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SCCP.-->

The current cap was configured to sUSD 40 million in [SCCP-87](https://sips.synthetix.io/SCCP/sccp-87) of which sUSD 39 million is currently utilized in shorts and borrows, so there is not much room for new users to take loans or shorts.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the variable change proposed.-->

The cap can be increased to sUSD 50 million to allow more users to take loans and shorts.

## Motivation

<!--The motivation is critical for SCCPs that want to update variables within Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing variable is not incentive aligned. SCCP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The cap of sUSD 40 million has almost been reached. Given that we want to promote using the new shorting mechanism as a longterm replacement for iSynths staking, increasing the cap gradually we approach full utilization would be the prudent approach.
