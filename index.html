  Synthetix Improvement Proposals (SIPs) describe standards for the Synthetix
  platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract
  standards.

<h2>Contributing</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Review <a href="https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-1">SIP-1</a>.</li>
  <li>
    Fork the repository by visiting the SIPs
    <a href="https://github.com/Synthetixio/SIPs">repo</a> and pressing "Fork"
    in the top right.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add your SIP to your fork of the repository. There is a
    <a href="https://github.com/Synthetixio/SIPs/blob/master/sip-x.md"
      >template SIP here</a
    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    Submit a Pull Request to Synthetix's
    <a href="https://github.com/synthetixio/SIPs">SIPs repository</a>.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Your first PR should be a first draft of the final SIP. It must meet the
  formatting criteria enforced by the build (largely, correct metadata in the
  header). An editor will manually review the first PR for a new SIP and assign
  it a number before merging it. Make sure you include a
  <code>discussions-to</code> header with the URL to a discussion forum or open
  GitHub issue where people can discuss the SIP as a whole.
</p>
<p>
  If your SIP requires images, the image files should be included in a
  subdirectory of the `assets` folder for that SIP as follow:
  <code>sips/assets/sip-X</code> (for sip <b>X</b>). When linking to an image in
  the SIP, use relative links such as <code>../assets/sip-X/image.png</code>.
</p>
<p>
  When you believe your SIP is mature and ready to progress past the WIP phase,
  you should reach out to a Spartan Council member on discord by searching
  members with the "Spartan Council" role or finding them within the #governance
  channel. The Spartan Council will schedule in a call with the SIP author to go
  through the SIP in more detail.
</p>

<p>
  If the Spartan Council has found that the SIP is valid, they will assign the
  <code>Proposed</code> status and call the SIP to a snapshot vote within the
  <code>spartancouncil.eth</code> snapshot space connected on the
  <a href="https://staking.synthetix.io/"> staking </a> dApp. Once the voting
  has ended, the SIP is assigned either a <code>Approved</code> or
  <code>Rejected</code> status depending on whether the SIP voting has reached a
  super majority.
</p>

<p>
  Once the SIP has been implemented by either the protocol DAO or the SIP author
  and relevant parties, the SIP is assigned the <code>Implemented</code> status.
  Community members who successfully reach this stage are entitled to a reward
  from the Synthetix Protocol.
</p>
