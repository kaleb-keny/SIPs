## Simple Summary

Provide support for synths in addition to sUSD on L2.

## Abstract

This SIP proposes adding support for minting and exchanging the following synths to L2: sBTC, sETH, sLINK, sTSLA, sDEFI, sAAVE, sUNI, sDOT.

## Motivation

To enable Kwenta and Minting on L2 to be consistent with L1 we want to make more synths besides sUSD available. Adding a range of new Synths on L2 will allow traders to speculate on the value of some of the best-known tokens in the ecosystem. This update is intended to attract more traders to Synthetix.Exchange, adding to the growing list of available Synths. Itâ€™s important to attract new traders to the platform, because the entire protocol is built around rewarding SNX stakers with fees generated by trding volume.

## Specification

These Synths will be implemented in the same way as the other Synths on L1. For sTSLA we will need to lock trading when markets close and unlock when markets open.

### Rationale

The most important considerations are around having consistent support for Synths on L2 that we have on L1. We have selected the more popular Synths to begin with and plan to add more synths later.

### Test Cases

TBD. Consistent with test cases on L1.
