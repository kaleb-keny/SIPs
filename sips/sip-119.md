<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your SIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->

Add a new long synth for Zcash (ZEC).

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->

Zcash has on average a billion dollars worth of trading volume per day, all of that on centralized exchanges. Synthetix can capture a sizeable share of that market by creating a ZEC synth and pooling that with renZEC in a Curve pool, enabling Curve cross-pool swaps. If sZEC is created in the future, a proposal to the Curve DAO to create a ZEC pool with sZEC will be made. Similarly to how native BTC can be deposited to Curve using Ren, ZEC could also natively be deposited to Curve, into a sZEC pool to then be tradable against BTC/USD/ETH using the synth cross-pool swaps.


## Motivation
<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->

Adding a ZEC synth could bring further further volume to the Synthetix protocol, and allow Zcash to enter the decentralized exchange market.


## Specification
<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview
<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->
The Synth will be implemented in the same way as other crypto Synths.

### Rationale
<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
The rationale for proposing ZEC above other assets is specifically because there exists a permissionless bridge by the Ren project from Zcash to Ethereum, allowing anyone anytime to wrap ZEC into renZEC 1:1, and allow anyone to redeem renZEC to native ZEC 1:1. Given that Curve has integrated the Ren bridge for BTC, the same can be done for ZEC, allowing anyone to go from native ZEC into a ZEC pool on Curve. And using the cross-pool synthswap, anyone could then go from native ZEC to BTC/ETH/USD low-slippage through Synthetix+Curve, which could turn into a substantial amount of volume for Synthetix, and provide an attractive service for crypto users.

### Technical Specification
<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->
The Coinbase Oracle could be used as a price feed for ZEC, or the Zcash foundation, the ECC and or the Ren team could be lobbied to request a Chainlink price feed.

### Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->
N/A

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)
<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
N/A
