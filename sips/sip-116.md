<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged SIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new SIPs. Note that an SIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your SIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `sip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->
Optimism is defining a new standard for deposit/withdrawal bridges between L1 and L2. This standard defines the function names and signatures for depositing tokens into L2, as well as for withdrawing them back to L1. We should update our contracts to adopt this new standard.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the SIP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the SIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->
The proposed changes involve renaming a few functions and events in two of our contracts as well as adding minor functionality to them to be able to deposit and withdraw SNX for another address. The contracts will need to be redeployed, and `SynthetixBridgeToOptimism`'s SNX balance will beed to be migrated to the new L1 bridge contract.

## Motivation
<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the SIP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate.  It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the SIP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is innaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the SIP will address the issue!-->
As Optimism's L2 gains adoption, more and more tokens will begin to move accross the layers. One example of this is the official WETH token to be used in place of ETH in Optimism's mainnet, which will comply to the deposit/withdrawal interface standard. Unless these changes are applied, Synthetix's bridges will need to be interacted with in a different way to all the other bridges. Another reason to migrate now is that a migration in the future could involve the migration of a much larger SNX value.

## Specification
<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview
<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the SIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->
Migrate our L1 and L2 bridges, `SynthetixBridgeToOptimism` and `SynthetixBridgeToBase` to conform to Optimism's standard deposit/withdrawal interface.

### Rationale
<!--This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
First, changes should be made to `SynthetixBridgeToOptimism` and `SynthetixBridgeToBase`. Following that, the corresponding test cases should be updated, and tests should be written to cover new functionality. Finally, the two contracts should be deployed on each layer, and linked to the system. The bridge in L1 is particularly sensitive because it locks a large number of funds.

### Technical Specification
<!--The technical specification should outline the public API of the changes proposed. That is, changes to any of the interfaces Synthetix currently exposes or the creations of new ones.-->

`SynthetixBridgeToOptimism` should adopt [`iOVM_L1ERC20Gateway`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/contracts/blob/master/contracts/optimistic-ethereum/iOVM/bridge/tokens/iOVM_L1ERC20Gateway.sol):
```solidity
interface iOVM_L1ERC20Gateway {
    function deposit(uint _amount) external;

    function depositTo(address _to, uint _amount) external;

    function finalizeWithdrawal(address _to, uint _amount) external;

    event DepositInitiated(address indexed _from, address _to, uint256 _amount);

    event WithdrawalFinalized(address indexed _to, uint256 _amount);
}
```

`SynthetixBridgeToBase` should adopt [`iOVM_L2DepositedERC20`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/contracts/blob/master/contracts/optimistic-ethereum/iOVM/bridge/tokens/iOVM_L2DepositedERC20.sol):
```solidity
interface iOVM_L2DepositedERC20 is IUniswapV2ERC20 {
    function withdraw(uint _amount) external;

    function withdrawTo(address _to, uint _amount) external;

    function finalizeDeposit(address _to, uint _amount) external;

    event WithdrawalInitiated(address indexed _from, address _to, uint256 _amount);

    event DepositFinalized(address indexed _to, uint256 _amount);
}
```

The bridges should implement these interface, as well as the previously existing `ISynthetixBridgeToOptimism` and `ISynthetixBridgeToBase` interfaces.

The new interface for `SynthetixBridgeToOptimism` should be:
```solidity
interface ISynthetixBridgeToOptimism {
    function migrateEscrow(uint256[][] calldata entryIDs) external;

    function depositReward(uint amount) external;

    function depositAndMigrateEscrow(uint256 depositAmount, uint256[][] calldata entryIDs) external;
}
```

The new interface for `SynthetixBridgeToBase` should be:
```solidity
interface ISynthetixBridgeToBase {
    function finalizeEscrowMigration(
        address account,
        uint256 escrowedAmount,
        VestingEntries.VestingEntry[] calldata vestingEntries
    ) external;

    function finalizeRewardDeposit(uint amount) external;
}
```

`SynthetixBridgeToOptimism`'s SNX balance will need to be migrated to the new `SynthetixBridgeToOptimism` contract, which will be achieved by calling the following function in the old contract:

`migrateBridge(address newBridge)` (https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/blob/develop/contracts/SynthetixBridgeToOptimism.sol#L139). To ensure the safety of this migration, a script will be used, ensuring:
* That the new bridge address is valid
* That the new bridge address is a contract
* That the new bridge owner is the same as the old one
* That the old bridge balance is not zero
* That the new bridge balance is zero

Additionally, the migration will be tested on a fork of mainnet before official execution on mainnet.

### Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->
All existing tests will be renamed accordingly.

New test cases:

* `depositTo(address to, uint256 amount)`
	* Same as `deposit(uint256 amount)` amount, with
	* `msg.sender` is account1
	* `to` is account2
	* `amount` is deduced from account1's balance in L1
	* `amount` is minted for account2 on L2

* `withdrawTo(address to, uint256 amount)`
	* Same as `withdraw(uint256 amount)` amount, with
	* `msg.sender` is account1
	* `to` is account2
	* `amount` is deduced from account1's balance in L2
	* `amount` is released for account2 on L1

### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)
<!--Please list all values configurable via SCCP under this implementation.-->
No new configurable values are involved with the proposed changes.
